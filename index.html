          <h5 class="card-title">Football rules</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Football rules also include fouls, which are violations of the game's laws that result in
            free-kicks or penalties. Fouls can include tripping, pushing, or using excessive force against an opponent.
            Additionally, players can be cautioned with a yellow card or sent off with a red card for serious offenses
            such as violent conduct or deliberate handball. The game is played with two teams of eleven players, and the
            objective is to score more goals than the opposing team by kicking the ball into their goal. The game is
            divided into two halves of 45 minutes each, with a halftime break in between.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Information about football</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Football, also known as soccer, is a popular sport played worldwide. It involves two
            teams of eleven players each, trying to score goals by kicking a ball into the opposing team's net. The game
            is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. Football requires skill, teamwork, and physical
            fitness. It is watched by millions of fans and has produced some of the greatest athletes in history. The
            World Cup, held every four years, is the most prestigious football tournament.</p>

        <div class="card-body">
          <h5 class="card-title">Offside</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Offside is a rule in football that prevents attacking players from being in an offside
            position when the ball is played to them by a teammate. A player is considered offside if they are closer to
            the opposing team's goal than both the ball and the second-to-last defender, at the moment the ball is
            played. If a player is offside, the opposing team is awarded a free-kick. The offside rule is designed to
            prevent players from gaining an unfair advantage by standing in an offside position and waiting for the ball
            to be played to them.</p>
